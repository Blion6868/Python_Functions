<h1>MOTIVATION</h1>

<h2>This repo showcases my data analytics skills, including a function to audit an e-commerce catalog and a class to determine commissions based on sales. </h2>

<h1>CODE STYLE</h1>

<h2>These projects were built in Python, using Jupyter notebooks for data exploration. While Jupyter notebooks are not often used in production, it allows for a more streamlined and readable code.</h2>
